       <h2 class="text-center">About Sony Service Center</h2>
       <h3 class="text-center">A Satisfied Customer is the Best Business Strategy.</h3><br>
       <h4 class="content">Hello and welcome`to Sony Service Center a place where you can your appliances
         such as Lcd / Led / Laptops and music system repaired and serviced.
         Service industry was never the same, earlier everything used to be by
         recommendations.<br><br> The business was heavily reliant on customer's satisfaction
         and their recommendations which helped companies like us to grow our business.
         The means of advertisement were less and mostly would cover a very small
         geographical area. Distributing pamphlets and giving advertorials in
         newspapers were enough. Sony Service Center has grown from those times
         to the digital times now. Most of the advertising techniques are now
         shifted to the internet which is a good thing.<br><br> The internet provides "Dynamic Customers"
         to customers. Dynamic customers are those who every time call different service provider
         for different repair works. This has led to the decreased interest of companies to provide
         satisfactory service to their customers, as they are confident that they may be not getting
         the same customer to serve the next time as their business is now currently dependent on dynamic
         customers.<br><br> This trend has been carefully observed by us and we are again making an effort
         to bring the same intentions and interest back to the companies serving in this field by
         providing a service which is more focused on customer satisfaction. Competition among
         service providers is healthy for service consumers. So we at Sony Service Center
         have started to make an honest effort to turn the tables and bring back the
         customers on the side which has the negotiating power rather than the service
         companies calling the shots.<br><br> We were in the early days mostly focussed on
         products made by sony and hence our name Sony Service Center as it
         was a trend to name companies like this but we actually not associated
         with sony company or not authorised to touch the products which are in
         warranty period provided by sony company. However, if you have any problem
         and don't have your product in the warranty period you can call us we would be
         happy to help you. We have been doing this work for more than 2 decades and have
         good contacts with experienced technicians so in case you need help feel free to
         call Sony Service Center.</h4>
